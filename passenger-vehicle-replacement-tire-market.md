<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Replacement Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passenger vehicle replacement tire market is primarily segmented into two types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires feature a construction where the cords run perpendicular to the tread, offering better fuel efficiency, improved grip, and enhanced durability. They are widely preferred for their performance on various road conditions. Bias tires, on the other hand, have cords that crisscross, providing a stiffer sidewall, which can be advantageous for certain vehicles. They typically offer a cost-effective option but may compromise on ride comfort and fuel efficiency compared to radial tires.</p></p>
